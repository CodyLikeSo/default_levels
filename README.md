1. Clone repo -> ```git clone https://github.com/CodyLikeSo/default_levels.git``` and then ```cd default_levels/```
2. Create VENV if needed: ```python -m venv .venv``` and activate ```source .venv/bin/activate```
3. Install packages from requirements.txt -> ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. start -> ```python sript.py```
